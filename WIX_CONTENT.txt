**Page Title:**
About Me

**Section 1 - Introduction:**

Hi, I'm James Baker, an iOS developer passionate about creating apps that solve real problems and make daily life easier.

I specialize in building native iOS applications with Swift and SwiftUI, focusing on intuitive user experiences and robust functionality. My apps range from language translation tools to travel companions and commuter utilities.

Each app I build combines practical utility with clean design, leveraging the latest iOS technologies and APIs. I'm particularly interested in AI integration, real-time data, and location-based services.

**Section 2 - What I Do:**

Title: What I Do

Bullet Points:
• iOS Development: Native Swift/SwiftUI applications
• AI Integration: Speech recognition, natural language processing
• Real-time Data: Transit schedules, weather, and live updates
• User Experience: Clean, intuitive interfaces that just work

DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WIX
========================================

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary Color: Blue (#007AFF - iOS blue)
- Secondary Color: Purple (#5856D6)
- Background: Light gray or white
- Text: Dark gray/black

**Layout Tips:**
1. Use Wix's "Blank Template" for maximum control
2. Add a sticky header with navigation
3. Use 3-column grid for the apps section
4. Add smooth scroll animations between sections
5. Make it mobile-responsive (Wix does this automatically)

**Images to Add:**
- App screenshots for each app (from App Store)
- App Store download badges (get from Apple's website)
- Optional: Your professional headshot in About section


========================================
HOW TO ADD IN WIX
========================================

1. **Create pages:** Home, About
2. **Add sections:** Drag "Strip" elements for each section
3. **Add text:** Use "Text" elements, copy/paste content above
4. **Add buttons:** Use "Button" elements, link to App Store URLs
5. **Add icons:** Use "Icon" elements or emoji in text
6. **Style it:** Click elements to change colors, fonts, spacing

That's it! Should take 10-15 minutes to set up.
